## Hi, I'm Jihyun.

I am a software engineer based in Singapore, from Korea, educated in Abu Dhabi. I was recently a part of [Entrepreneur First](https://joinef.com) in Singapore.

I believe that all technology should serve more than the few that build it. As a part of this belief, I worked on a [dream project](https://www.survivalofthebestfit.com/) with a dream team to help the public better understand AI and hiring bias.
